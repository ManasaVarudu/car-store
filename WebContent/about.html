<h2>About our cars</h2>

    <div class="para">
		<p>For your total peace of mind, every car we sell is thoroughly inspected by a fully trained Technician and comes with a three month guarantee, with the option to extend this for a further two years. All of our cars under a 104-point mechanical and cosmetic inspection to ensure that they are sold to you in tip-top condition. We also guarantee that the cars we sell are the lowest priced in the market, if you find the same car at a local competitor cheaper - we'll refund you the difference.</p>
		<p>We get it, buying a car is a big deal. So, to ensure that you're head over heels about your new car and give you that added peace of mind when buying, we offer a 7 Day Money Back Guarantee. This means if there's something not quite right, you can return it or exchange for another car from us. </p>
		<p>With thousands of quality cars to choose from and the option to part exchange, once you have bought your dream car, we'll then look after you with tailored aftercare packages. </p>
		<p>Just looking to sell? That's okay too - we'll buy your car even if you don't buy another one from us.</p>

 <h2>Our Vision </h2>
	<div>
		
		<p>We sell cars but we're doing things differently at Car Store. We understand our customers' wants and needs and our vision is to transform the car buying experience – and we're just getting started!</p>
		<p>Our employees are partners in our future & stakeholders in our desires. We will all lead & act in line with our core values.

Our strategic intent is to help our customers create significant competitive advantage by constantly leading in connected data, information & knowledge provision, ultimately improving our customers’ work processes, informed decision making & business results.

We actively encourage our customers to provide feedback on how we are doing against our stated Vision and Mission…</p>

<p>We pursue a business ethic of continuous improvement and whilst we recognise that we will not always get everything right for all our customers, we rely on a close and honest relationship to ensure that we have the very best opportunity to provide an exceptional experience every time.

To help us to improve our service to you, please contact us at customer.experience@jato.com and wherever you are in the world, we will get back to you within 24 hours.</p>

  <h2> Our Mission</h2>
	<div>
	<p>The reason we stay loyal to brands is because of their values. The best brands strive to combine physical, emotional, and logical elements into one exceptional customer (and employee) experience that you value as much as they do. Nowhere are those values more visible than in the company's mission statement.

When you successfully create a connection with your customers and employees, many of them might stay loyal to you for life. This helps you increase your overall profitability while building a solid foundation of brand promoters.

But achieving that connection is no easy task. The companies that succeed are ones that stay true to their core values over the years and create a company that employees and customers are proud to associate with.
		<p>For us to achieve our vision, we have a very clear mission statement: To Win Fans and Friends.</p>
		</p>
		<p>We do this not just by providing a good car buying and aftercare service, but the absolute best experience out there. Our fans and friends love us because of our people and our #carstorestyle, which is our unique way of doing things.
